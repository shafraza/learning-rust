basic program for practice

I have written a code to solve a problem that involves computing the sum of even numbers in a vector of integers. The code defines a function called sum_even_numbers that takes a reference to a vector of integers as input. Inside the function, the filter function is used to create a new iterator of even numbers, and then the fold function is used to sum those even numbers. The main function calls the sum_even_numbers function and passes a vector of integers to it, then prints the sum of even numbers to the console. This code aims to provide an efficient solution to the problem of finding the sum of even numbers in a vector of integers.
